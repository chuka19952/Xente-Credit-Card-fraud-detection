# About dataset
# Xente is an e-commerce and financial service app serving 10,000+ customers in Uganda.

This dataset includes a sample of approximately 140,000 transactions that occurred between 15 November 2018 and 15 March 2019.

One of the challenges of fraud detection problems is that the data is highly imbalanced. See these blogs for examples on how imbalanced data might be handled:

# The files for download here are:

    Xente_variable_definitions.csv: Definition of the features per transaction
    Training.csv: Transactions from 15 November 2018 to 13 February 2019, including whether or not each transaction is fraudulent
    Test.csv: Transactions from 13 February 2019 to 14 March 2019, not including whether or not each transaction is fraudulent

# error metric
The error metric for this competition is the F1 score, which ranges from 0 (total failure) to 1 (perfect score). Hence, the closer your score is to 1, the better your model.

F1 Score: A performance score that combines both precision and recall. It is a harmonic mean of these two variables. Formula is given as: 2*Precision*Recall/(Precision + Recall)

Precision: This is an indicator of the number of items correctly identified as positive out of total items identified as positive. Formula is given as: TP/(TP+FP)

Recall / Sensitivity / True Positive Rate (TPR): This is an indicator of the number of items correctly identified as positive out of total actual positives. Formula is given as: TP/(TP+FN)

Where:

    TP=True Positive

    FP=False Positive

    TN=True Negative

    FN=False Negative
